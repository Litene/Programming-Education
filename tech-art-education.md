## Basic Programming (C#)

Idea  is to get a basic grasp of programming because this will help a lot with understanding and syntax.
The goal is to be able to create small programs in terminal, solve mathematical problems and implement basic
features in Unity. 

We begin with super basic stuff and ramp upp quickly, meaning we start with stuff you likely already know.
Try not to breeze through these too quick, it is always good to repeat basics, do the task even its repetitive!

The tasks below will serve as a backbone to track how much you've learned, they are not really in the best order,
some easier are toward the beginning but scroll through them from time to time and when you feel ready to try one. 
These are not meant to be solved with little to none googling or outside help, they are for your eyes only. 

One thing that id like to stress, learning programming is quite heavy in the beginning, 
most of the time you will feel like you are understanding anything and are just struggling, the tasks are meant 
to prevent this a bit by giving you a metric on your progress. These are not gonna be the only metric a long the "course", and 
all of these are meant to be completed without tutorials or chatGPT, you are only allowed to google very specific things.

Learning programming for most is a lot of trying a failing, the more you fuck around the more you learn.

The final part of the programming part is to do a game jam with friends as a programmer!

Some things are very simplified for learning purposes, example: 
You always place brackets after doing X, this statement is likely true for almost all cases, but its better to learning
the rules then learning the exceptions. 

```csharp
namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}
```

### Part 0 Setup
#### Installing the IDE
There are many choices for IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Jetbrains Rider is arguably the best one, and is not free for personal use.
Rider provides something called Syntax highlighting/intellisense for HLSL (which makes programming a lot easier), compiles faster (fast load times)
and better suggestions compared to its competitors.

Go through the installation normally and click in add file associations, 

#### Setting it up perfectly for you
I'll give a few tips which I feel is useful and makes it easier to code.

### Part 1 The Basic Basics

Every part of this little course will come with 10 exercises.
The last one being a little bigger where you are encourages to experiment.

The education is a good mix of different sources and my own opinions, for the first section W3Schools

Where you will do all the basics as listed here: [W3Schools Tutorial](https://github.com/Litene/Note/blob/main/Note/programming-education/W3.png)



```csharp
static void ___(string[] args) {
  ___.___("Hello World!");    
}
```
